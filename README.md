Running the index.html from "UFO-level-1" in your browser will enable you to filer the data by date. The table contain all data will load  upon page and I have also added code that will return the full table of data once the selection is removed and either you hit "enter" or click "filter again. 

Running the index.html from "UFO-level-2" in your browser will also enable you to filter the data by date, as well as city, state, country and shape. I have made it so that when filtering by these additional categories an exact match is not required. The code will also correct for capitilisation, given all table data is in lowercase. However, for some reason the table will not render by simply hitting enter. You will have to click on the filter table button to filter.

To complete section two I had to significantly change my approach from what I did in level 1. If I were to do this again I would use the approach in level 2 in level 1. However, for the sake of showing my working and because the code in level 1 does still work, I have left it as is.
